This project contains modifications to the Texas Instruments Code Composer Studio 6.2 device files to fix issues

ccsv6\ccs_base\common\targetdb\devices\66AK2H12.xml
===================================================

Modified version from Keystone2 device support 1.1.9 com.ti.emulation.keystone2.win32.feature.group to
1) Add missing nodes which prevented collection of ETB trace
on the Cortex-A15 CPUs as reported in https://e2e.ti.com/support/development_tools/code_composer_studio/f/81/t/511744

2) Set the TraceDeviceId for the CS Embedded Trace Buffer in a 66AK2H12,
the lack of which was causing System Trace to fail to capture any samples.
The TraceDeviceId value was taken from the TCI6638K2K.xml file.
